    <div id="div2"><p id="p2">Text that is being RECIEVED will be translated here</p></div>
    <p id="rules">This translator is limited to some capacity since it is the first version. It currently can only accept symbols such as '!', '.', and '?'. It also cannot accept numbers such '10' but it can accept it in string form - such as 'ten'.
        <br><br> Also due to the site being big dumb you will have to press the refresh button after every translation otherwise it will not work - this issue shall be fixed.
